# Gemini‑Generated Meeting Assistant

A browser-based AI meeting assistant that listens to your voice, transcribes it, and gives context-aware responses — all powered via the Gemini API. This is a self-contained web application designed to run fully client-side.

## 🧠 How It Works (Inferred)

Even though this was generated by Gemini, we can see key components reflected in the code:

- UI built with standard HTML and Tailwind CSS (via CDN)  
- Logic implemented in vanilla JavaScript  
- Audio capture via `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` + `MediaRecorder`  
- File reading (PDF, text, image) for inline context  
- Calls the Gemini 2.5 Flash API model for generation  
- Static‑site friendly — works when hosted on GitHub Pages or similar
